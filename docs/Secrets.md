# Step 2: Configure Secrets

!!! overview
    - Configure `.kamal/secrets`

In your `config/deploy.yml`, you listed your secrets but not their values. Those values are extracted using a script that you can find in `.kamal/secrets`.

```yaml title=".kamal/secrets" hl_lines="9-29 35 39" linenums="1"
# Secrets defined here are available for reference under registry/password,
# env/secret, builder/secrets, and accessories/*/env/secret in
# config/deploy.yml. All secrets should be pulled from either password
# manager, ENV, or a file. DO NOT ENTER RAW CREDENTIALS HERE! This file
# needs to be safe for git.

# Example of extracting secrets from 1password (or another compatible
# pw manager)
SECRETS=$(kamal secrets fetch
  --adapter 1password
  --account your-account
  --from Vault/Item
  KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
  RAILS_MASTER_KEY
  ACCESS_KEY_ID
  SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  ENDPOINT_URL
  REGION BUCKET_NAME
)

KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(kamal secrets extract
  KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD ${SECRETS})

RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(kamal secrets extract RAILS_MASTER_KEY ${SECRETS})
ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(kamal secrets extract ACCESS_KEY_ID ${SECRETS})
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(kamal secrets extract SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ${SECRETS})
ENDPOINT_URL=$(kamal secrets extract ENDPOINT_URL ${SECRETS})
REGION=$(kamal secrets extract REGION ${SECRETS})
BUCKET_NAME=$(kamal secrets extract BUCKET_NAME ${SECRETS})

# Use a GITHUB_TOKEN if private repositories are needed for the image
# GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh config get -h github.com oauth_token)

# Grab the registry password from ENV
# KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

# Improve security by using a password manager.
# Never check config/master.key into git!
# RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
```

This file has examples of four ways to get your secrets: from a password manager, obtaining the
output from a command, or from the environment, or from a file. The password manager is the most secure, and is the one we recommend you use.

Uncomment this section, [select the appropriate adapter](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/commands/secrets/),
and add the Object Storage (S3) secrets, unless you have already added them to `config/credentials.yml.enc`.

!!! note
    Other popular ways are `.env` files and, for Rails, `config/credentials.yml`. `.env` files are the easiest to use, but also are the easiest to accidentally expose your secrets.
    `config/credentials.yml` is better, but you still are left with a master key that you need
    to provide in other ways.

Now place all of the secrets you gathered while assembling your ingredients into your password manager. You can find the `MASTER_KEY` in your Rails app at `config/master.key`.

While it is possible to include your secrets here, doing so is strongly discouraged. If you choose to do it anyway, be sure to add this file to your `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files.
